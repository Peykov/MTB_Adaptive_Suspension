    "# Adpative Suspension Mountain Bike\n",
    "#### Real-time terrain analysis and optimization for mountain bike suspension efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "- #### Not optimal response of the suspension to the variety of the terrain conditions, features, obstacles and rider's input.\n",
    "- ####  So many variables left solely to the rider to adjust constantly with his physical input (body position, weight distribution) during the descent. The suspension responsiveness and efficiency stays constant through the ride. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible big improvements that could be achieved by optimizing the suspension settings in real-time:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Turns ( high low speed compression, fast high speed rebound)\n",
    "    - Jumps ( mid-stroke support, fast high speed rebound), preload \n",
    "    - Drops ( softer combination before the drop, firmer on the landing )\n",
    "    - Rock gardens ( mid-stroke support, fast high speed rebound)\n",
    "    - Roots ( fast high speed rebound, fast highspeed comression)\n",
    "    - Straight steep lines ( soft overall combination of settings)\n",
    "    - Flat corners etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Could be adapted for tyre pressure live optimization as well\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output: Rebound and Compression settings\n",
    "    - Rebound: How fast the suspension returns to its original position after being compressed \n",
    "        - fast speed rebound (range(1,12)); low speed rebound (range(1,12))\n",
    "    - Compression: How much and how fast the suspension compresses when a force is applied to it ( firm - soft)\n",
    "        - low speed compression (range(1:10)) - fast speed compression (range(1:10))\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The output has to be send as signal in time ( amplitude and frequency) converted in mechanical rotation of rebound and compression knobs of the suspension fork and shock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input: Suspension travel, force applied and Trail(road) detection \n",
    "- Possible input recievers: \n",
    "    - Lidar\n",
    "    - Camera\n",
    "    - IMU ( inertial measurement unit)\n",
    "    - GPS\n",
    "    - Force sensors\n",
    "    - Suspension sensors and metrics \n",
    "\n",
    "### Developments in the field:\n",
    "- Rockshox Flight Attendent system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Transfer \n",
    "- Automotive industry - adaptive suspension systems\n",
    "    - AUDI's predictive active suspension system\n",
    "    - Mercedes-Benz's Magic Body Control\n",
    "    - Lincoln's Continuously Controlled Damping\n",
    "    - etc. \n",
    "- Main point: Concretration on solutions that provide and specialize in recognition of road topography conditions and features\n",
    "    - Crucial for the project is Computer Vision: identification and classification of the surfaces before they are reached and allowing predictively regulation of the active suspension\n",
    "\n",
    "## POC (PROOF OF CONCEPT)\n",
    "   \n",
    "- CV: detecting a flat surface and a bump ( jump or turn )\n",
    "- Computer vision as first step because we have abundance of GoPro footage from the trails and bikeparks that could be used for training the model\n",
    "- Best approaches for image processing, object detection and classification: CNN's (Convolutional Neural Network)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Searching of usefull data for training the model\n",
    "    - Kagle, Roboflow\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Constructing a specific dataset for the purpose\n",
    "    - Building custom dataset from GoPro footage - extracted frames from multiple videos\n",
    "    - Trying autolabeling frameworks ( jump, bump, turn)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The success of the model depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the training data. The collection a diverse and robust dataset of trail images with various types of bumps and features under different lighting and weather conditions. "
